How good are these predictions: 

We got MSE = 1.9271, with a target range of min = 0.1 and max = 2.5
The variance of target values is 0.5810 so the baseline MSE (predicting mean)
is 0.5771.

The MSE of 1.9271 is not good since it is significantly higher then both the variance of the 
target values and the baseline MSE.

The model is performing worse than a simple baseline model that predicts the mean of the target
values for all inputs, which indicates that there is room for improvement ...
